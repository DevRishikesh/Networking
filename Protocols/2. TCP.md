# 🔁 TCP (Transmission Control Protocol)

## 🧾 What is TCP?
**TCP** is a **connection-oriented** and **reliable** transport protocol used to ensure the accurate delivery of data between devices over a network.
It is one of the core protocols of the **Transport Layer** in both the **TCP/IP** and **OSI models**.
---
## Key Features of TCP
- **Connection-Oriented**: Establishes a connection before data transfer using a 3-way handshake.
- **Reliable**: Guarantees delivery of packets in correct order.
- **Error Checking**: Detects and corrects lost or corrupted data.
- **Flow Control**: Manages how much data is sent at a time.
- **Congestion Control**: Adjusts sending rate based on network conditions.
- **Sequencing**: Data is numbered and reassembled in order.

## TCP 3-Way Handshake
The handshake process to establish a connection:
 ```txt 
Client             Server
  |-| ---- SYN ----> |-|
  | | <--- SYN-ACK --| |
  |-| ---- ACK ----> |-|
```
- **SYN:** Client wants to start a connection.
- **SYN-ACK:** Server agrees and responds.
- **ACK:** Client confirms.
- After this, the connection is established and data can be sent.

## TCP Segment Structure
 ```txt
[Source Port] [Destination Port]
[Sequence Number] [Acknowledgment Number]
[Flags: SYN, ACK, FIN, etc.]
[Window Size]
[Checksum]
[Data]
```
---
## Use Cases
- Web browsing (HTTP/HTTPS)
- Email services (SMTP, IMAP)
- File transfers (FTP)
- Reliable application layer data delivery

##  TCP Flags Overview
| Flag	| Description |
|-------|-------------|
| SYN	| Initiate connection | 
| ACK	| Acknowledgment | 
| FIN	| Terminate connection |
| RST |	Reset connection |
| PSH	| Push data to application now |
| URG	 | Urgent pointer field is valid |
---
## TCP Flow Control
TCP uses Window Size and Acknowledgment Numbers to control how much data can be sent before waiting for an acknowledgment. This avoids overwhelming the receiver.
---
## Summary
- TCP is a reliable, ordered, connection-based protocol.
- Ensures error free data delivery using the 3-way handshake.
- Used in most web based applications where accuracy matters.
> *Think of TCP as the post office with tracking and delivery confirmation, slow but reliable!*
