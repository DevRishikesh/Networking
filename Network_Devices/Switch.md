## What is switch?
- A **switch** is a network device that connects multiple devices (computers, printers, etc.) in a **local area network (LAN)** and forwards data to the correct destination device.
## How It Works
- Operates at **Layer 2 (Data Link Layer)** of the OSI model.
- Uses **MAC addresses** to forward frames.
- Maintains a **MAC address table** (or CAM table) to track devices.
## Key Features
- Reduces network collisions.
- Full-duplex communication (send and receive at the same time).
- Improves performance over hubs.
## Real-World Use
- Used in **offices, schools, and homes** to connect computers, printers, etc.
- Core part of most **LAN setups**.
## Example
- If PC1 wants to send data to PC3, the switch checks its MAC table and forwards it **only to PC3**, not to everyone.
