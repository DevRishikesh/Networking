## What is a Hub?
A **hub** is a basic networking device that connects multiple devices in a **Local Area Network (LAN)** and allows them to communicate.
However, it is considered a **“dumb” device** because it simply **broadcasts data to all connected devices**, regardless of the intended destination.
## How It Works
- Operates at **Layer 1 (Physical Layer)** of the OSI model.
- When one device sends data, the hub **forwards it to all ports**.
- All connected devices receive the data, but only the intended one accepts it.
## Key Characteristics
- No traffic management or intelligence.
- Leads to **collisions** when multiple devices send data at once.
- All ports share the same bandwidth.
- Simple and inexpensive, but outdated.
## Real-World Use
- Rarely used today due to inefficiency.
- Previously used in small home or office networks.
- May still be used in **labs** or **testing environments**.
## Example
If PC1 sends data to PC2:
- The hub **sends it to PC2, PC3, and PC4**.
- Only PC2 accepts the data; others discard it.
- This creates **unnecessary traffic**.
