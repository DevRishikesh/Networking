# Networking Notes & Cheatsheets

Welcome to my **Networking Documentation Repository** built to help you (and me 😎) learn, revise, and master the most important networking concepts in a clean, practical, and well-documented format.

Whether you're a beginner, student, or prepping for certifications (like CCNA, CEH, etc.), this repo is a **shortcut to understanding real-world networking**.

## Why I Built This

I made this repo as part of my personal learning journey in computer networks to simplify the concepts I study and share what actually helps in **exams, interviews, and real-life networking tasks**.

> “Learn it. Document it. Share it.”
