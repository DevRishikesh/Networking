# 📡 Networking Notes

Welcome to my personal repository of networking notes!  
This repo documents everything I'm learning about computer networks — from the OSI model to real-world protocols and tools.

## 🧠 What You’ll Find Here

This is a **structured and beginner-friendly** learning journal. I’ve organized the content by core networking topics with diagrams, summaries, and cheat sheets.

Each folder contains topic-wise markdown notes and related diagrams.

## 📈 Why I’m Doing This

I’m learning computer networking to build a solid foundation for systems, cybersecurity, and backend development.  
This repo serves as both a revision tool and a way to share my journey with others.
